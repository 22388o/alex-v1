# Collateral Rebalancing Pool

Collateral Rebalancing Pool \("CRP"\) uses [Weighted Equation](platform-architecture-that-supports-ecosystem-development.md#weighted-equation) and dynamically rebalances between ayToken and Collateral.

CRP dynamically rebalances collateral to ensure the ayToken minted \(i.e. the loan\) remain solvent especially in an adverse market environment \(i.e. the value of the loan does not exceed the value of collateral\). This dynamic rebalancing, together with a careful choice of the key parameters \(including LTV and volatilty assumption\) allows ALEX to eliminate the needs for liquidation. Any residual gap risk \(which CRP cannot address entirely\) is addressed through maintaining a strong reserve fund.

When a Borrower mints ayToken by providing appropriate Collateral, the Collateral is converted into a basket of Collateral and Token, with the weights determined by CRP. CRP determines the weights based on the prevailing LTV and uses the following formula:

$$
\begin{split}
&w_{Token}=N\left(d_{1}\right)\\
&w_{Collateral}=\left(1-w_{Token}\right)\\
&d_{1}= \frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{t}}\left[\ln\left(\frac{LTV_{t}}{LTV_{0}}\right) + t\times\left(APY_{Token}-APY_{Collateral} + \frac{\sigma^2}{2}\right)\right]
\end{split}
$$

Some readers may note the similarity of the above formula to the [Black & Scholes delta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackâ€“Scholes_model), because it is. CRP essentially implements a delta replicating strategy of a call option on Token / Collateral, buying more Token when LTV moves higher and vice versa.
